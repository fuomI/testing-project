# TODO

> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- I found the experience to be quite enjoyable. I prefer practical assigments over theory and multichoice tests.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?

- First I checked the "todos" to find out what to test. Next I wrote the testsuit alongside trying out the application.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management,

- For assigment of this size I found that writing the testsuits in .txt format was suitable.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I used VisualStudio Code for editing the testsuits and bugreport. For the readme file of my repository I used Notepad++.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I had trouble with linking the screenshot in Bugreport correctly but the reason was that I had a brainfreeze when determining the path.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- I have used Github since my first semester and I have uploaded all of my relevant projects there so using Github was not a huge issue to me.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I would probably use Robot Framework since it is popular and has easy-to-use reputation. I have not used testing frameworks of this kind. However, I have written unit tests with jUnit and continue to do so in my journey as a Java Developer.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Playwright, Gherkin, Cucumber
- Jira
- DevOps
- Git, GitLab
- Functional testing, DB and API manual testing
- Experience with json, xml, csv formats
- Experience working in agile environment

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- I need to learn PLaywright, Gherkin & Cucumber
- I need to get more familiar with GitLab also

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

- I felt that the theory part focusing on ISTQB had too many new terms and concepts to grasp. However, I really enjoyed the final assignment. Maybe instead of multichoice questions to test theory knowledge I would create mini assignments to test the theory if applicable. Overall, I enjoyed the course and I haven now more knowledge of Software testing field.
